== Resume Renderer (in Typst)

This package is what I use to render my resume in Typst. The purpose of it is to serve as a viable replacement for my resume in LaTeX, of which is immensely verbose.

It is likely that I will be updating this as time goes on. At the moment, the module has enough functionality to replace my LaTeX resume â€” which was my intent.
